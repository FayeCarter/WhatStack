# Outline
In this project we were given two weeks as a team of 5 to build a product to solve a problem, witha  feature freeze on the second Wednesday and a demonstration on the final day.

# Specifications

During out time at makers we have been blocked. A lot. Asking for help can be tough, it's difficult to acknowledge your own ignorance and sometimes places can be less than welcoming to newcomers asking a question that's been covered before - think back to all the times you've seen someone on stackoverflow saying "that's a stupid question" or "This is a duplicate of \<some other question which while similar isn't actually your question>" we decided that 
- it shouldn't be so hard to ask for help 
- you can reach a solution quicker through a 5 minute conversation than posting a question on a message board and hoping someone gets back to you with something more positive than "that's a stupid question"
- if someone has the same problem as you, they should be able to be part of that conversation.

# User Stories

need either a list of user stories here or a link to all the user stories - check and confirm what user stories we've achieved.

## Logging in

Whatstack is designed to be easy to access for developers, so instead of having to create an account and register, you can simply login with your Github account.

## opening a chat room

once you're logged in you'll be taken to the /rooms screen, which is where you can either make a new room to help you with your problem, or if you see another room already there that covers it you can join that conversation instead.

## sending (*plaintext*) messages

Once you're in a room you can contribute to the conversation by typing your message into the text area and clicking the 'send message' button.

## sending (*codeblock*) messages

Want to send a block of code? No problem, simply add three backtics (\`\`\`) to the beginning and end of your code block, you can even specify a language for the code to be formatted in by writing the language immediately after the backticks e.g. \`\`\`ruby \<some code> \`\`\` and the result will be a code block correctly highlighted in the ruby style. The language is set to javascript by default.
